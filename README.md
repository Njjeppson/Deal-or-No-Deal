# Deal-or-No-Deal

This program will recreate the gameplay of Deal or No Deal. Deal or No Deal is a gameshow/arcade game in which a contestant is presented with 26 cases, each randomly assigned a different cash value. The contestant begins by selected one case to keep as their own. The contestant then repeatedly opens cases, revealing the cash values that are not in their personal case. Periodically, the "dealer" will drop in, offering a price for the contestant's case. If the player declines, the game continues and they open more cases, presenting the opportunity to raise or lower the dealer's price. If they hold out to the end, they keep their personal case. However, if they accept the dealer's offer, the game ends and the contents of the case are revealed, showing how much money the player would have won otherwise.
